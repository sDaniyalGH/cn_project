Graph Neural Networks for Recommender Systems (UltraGCN) 

· Implemented UltraGCN and LightGCN architectures using PyTorch to model user-item interactions in collaborative
filtering.

· Addressed the **Oversmoothing** problem in GCNs by approximating infinite-layer message passing with a simplified
loss function.

· Optimized embedding learning using **Negative Sampling** and Xavier Initialization.
